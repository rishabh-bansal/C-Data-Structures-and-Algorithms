This repository contains data structures and algorithms written in C and C++.

# Use cases
Users can look through the repository and learn about the implementation of each data structure and algorithm. They can also be used in programs.

# Installation
Simply downloading the repository and adding the corresponding data structure or algorithm files to the preprocessor (#include "<yourFile.cpp>") of the C++ file that is using it.
